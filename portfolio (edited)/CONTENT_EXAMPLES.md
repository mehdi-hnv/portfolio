## 👤 ABOUT PAGE Examples

### Background Story
**Example 1:**
```
I started coding in 2018 with a simple goal: solve real problems with clean, 
efficient code. After completing my Computer Science degree and a bootcamp 
program, I've spent the last 5 years building web applications that serve 
thousands of daily users.

My journey has taken me from junior developer fixing bugs to senior developer 
architecting systems. I've learned that great code is invisible to users—
they only notice when it works perfectly.

This is where I share my best work and lessons learned along the way.
```

**Example 2:**
```
I'm a self-taught developer who found passion in building digital solutions.
Started with curiosity, moved to Codecademy, built first project, got hired.
Fast forward 6 years: I've worked at startups and enterprises, always focusing
on how to make websites faster, more reliable, and more beautiful.

Now I freelance and teach, helping others avoid the mistakes I made early on.
